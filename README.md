# Ancalagon-Bot
Ancalagon Bot, or as it's called "AncalaBot" was a bot I made for a (now dead) server my friend ran called Ancalagon. This bot was meant to be my first introduction to discord.js and was meant to be a really good bot but never really made a full release.

The project is now dead, I'm doing other stuff but I will continue to respond to pull requests but I'm not contributing anything anymore.

Do whatever you like with the bot code (as long as it abides by the license), I don't really mind.
