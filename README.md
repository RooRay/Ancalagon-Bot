# Ancalagon-Bot
Ancalagon Bot, or as it's called "AncalaBot" was a bot I made for a (now dead) server my friend ran called Ancalagon. This bot was meant to be my first introduction to discord.js and was meant to be a really good bot but never really made a full release.

The project is now dead, I'm doing other stuff but I will continue to respond to pull requests but I'm not contributing anything anymore.

Do whatever you like with the bot code (as long as it abides by the license), I don't really mind.

# How to use
This project was initally made in glitch (glitch.com) so I'm unsure if it will work on proper bot hosting sites. So try it if you want.
To run it just add the package.json, main.js and .env files and then in the .env file add your token replacing the "YOURTOKENHERE" text.
